            <h3>Nature and Characteristics of Submissions</h3>
            <p>Your submission could be a text, a podcast or a video. Whatever it is, it must be of very good quality and follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose or name a field (create a drop down), but your example can certainly be transferred to other areas</li>
                <li>Describe your action or story and the context. The context matters; you may say what you do in a paragraph (one action and one context at a time).</li>
                <li>The second paragraph may describe the type of positive transformation your action has produced. If you have difficulty identifying the impact of your action, you should reconsider the action itself.</li>
                <li>The last paragraph may state words of caution in replicating your act (if any).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Characteristics of Video submissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not like writing or consider yourself a powerful and convincing speaker or narrator, send us a short quality video (no more than 3-4 minutes.)</li>
                <li>Your video must be of very good picture quality (at least 1080 dpi).</li>
                <li>Get experienced amateur of professional’s help for shooting.</li>
                <li>Make sure the sound is clear by placing the microphone in the right angle to avoid the p’s that pop up in amateur jobs.</li>
                <li>Uploading the video file does not guarantee it will be used, because we have to guarantee its quality</li>
            </ul>
