            <h3>Nature and Characteristics of Submissions</h3>
            <p>Your submission could be a text, a podcast or a video. Whatever it is, it must be of very good quality and follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose or name a field (create a drop down), but your example can certainly be transferred to other areas</li>
                <li>Describe your action or story and the context. The context matters; you may say what you do in a paragraph (one action and one context at a time).</li>
                <li>The second paragraph may describe the type of positive transformation your action has produced. If you have difficulty identifying the impact of your action, you should reconsider the action itself.</li>
                <li>The last paragraph may state words of caution in replicating your act (if any).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Characteristics of Podcast submissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not like writing or consider yourself a powerful and convincing speaker or narrator, send us a short quality video (sound and picture) or a quality podcast (no more than 3-4 minutes).</li>
                <li>If you are sure of the quality of your podcast, please record your own voice and edit your file before sending it to us.</li>
                <li>If you want us to create a podcast with your text, let us know, but it will not be your voice.</li>
                <li>Whatever equipment you are using to record (computer,  microphone or another equipment like Zoom H2N or H4NSP), make sure there is no ambient noise or background sound interference</li>
                <li>If you are using a computer, try and use an external microphone away from the computer that may itself make a noise.</li>
                <li>Your audio file must be converted to MP3 or OGG.</li>
                <li>Uploading the audio file does not guarantee it will be used, because we have to guarantee its quality.</li>
            </ul>
